To compile using Maven (mvn): 

mvn clean release:clean release:prepare release:perform

To release on maven central, go to:

https://oss.sonatype.org/
(username: janvanrijn)

Guide:

Apache Maven Section:
https://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html

Basically, the following requirements need to be met:
* POM.xml requires a distributionManagement tag with servers
* Settings file requires username / password for all servers (~/.m2/settings.xml)
* GPG key should be available on the system (can be refered to in settings file)

Known errors:

* JAVA_HOME needs to be set
Can find Java alternatives by running `sudo update-alternatives --config java`
Omit bin directory (e.g., `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64`)

* command get_passphrase failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
You should set yout GPG_TTY variable for it to work, as in [this document](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Invoking-GPG_002dAGENT.html):

```
GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export GPG_TTY
```
